This is a game of chess played from your computer's terminal.

The game can be played with two players alternating turns, or one player against themselves.

There is currently no AI player to play against.

Draws from 'Insufficient Material' currently only consider instances where both players are reduced to a single King piece.

To make a play, select a piece with standard algebraic notation (ie: 'a2') and then select a target square to move that piece to the same way.

Castling is done by selecting your King piece, and moving it to the proper square when legal to do so (the Rook will move automatically).

A few tests have been written in game_spec.rb
